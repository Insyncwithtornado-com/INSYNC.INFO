  <h2>
    Our Inception
  </h2>

  <br>
  
  <p>
    Initially we began as a Biker Apparel online store in 2024 December, that should account for our over the top name. Within months of operating, we realized a potential for more, a better positioning within the grand scheme of things. <br> <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Within ourselves we had practically seasoned marketers, Project Managers and web developers with OVER A DECADE of experience in their fields.
  </p>

  <br> <br>

  <h2>
    Our Evolution
  </h2>

  <br>

  <p>
    We naturally gravitated towards what we were good at, only this time we were doing it on our terms and for our benefit. <br> <br>
    </p>

      <p><b>
    REST ASSURED OUR SELF INTEREST AND HONESTY ABOUT IT, IS EXACTLY WHAT MAKES US GREAT AT WHAT WE DO.</b>
  </p>

  <p><b>
    <br><Br> IT IS OUR SELF INTEREST THAT DRIVES US TO DELIVER AND BUILD BRIDGES.<BR><br></b>
    </p>

    <p><b>
      GIVE 200% ALL THE TIME, NOT FOR YOU BUT FOR US <BR><br></b>
      </p>

      <p><b>
      FOR OUR CREDIBILITY AND OUR FUTURE AS PARTNERS WITH ALL WHO COME ACROSS OUR STORM.
      </b>
